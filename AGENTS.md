# FluentFlow Local Agent Notes

## Purpose

This repository is the independent source repository for FluentFlow Local: a local-first video/audio transcription and note workspace. Its HTTP application is `backend/local_main.py`; it must not acquire hosted accounts, quotas, deployment configuration, or cloud-only administration.

Before any implementation or handoff, read `docs/edition_boundaries.md` and
confirm that the task belongs to Local. Historical export terminology is not a
current workflow. If the task is for Hosted, switch to the independent
`fluentflow` repository and follow its `AGENTS.md`.

## Boundaries

- Keep runtime data outside the repository. Never commit `.env`, credentials, databases, media, transcripts, notes, logs, exports, `node_modules/`, `.venv/`, or `frontend/dist-local/`.
- Preserve compatibility with existing runtime paths in `backend/core/runtime_paths.py`; do not move or delete user data as part of source maintenance.
- The macOS and Windows launchers are product surfaces. Local frontend changes build to `frontend/dist-local` and are served by `backend.local_main`.
- This repository is independently maintained. Do not add an export-from-another-repository workflow or generated-source provenance files.
- Shared capabilities are deliberately ported, reviewed, tested, and committed
  in each repository; never assume a change here reaches Hosted automatically.

## Validation

Before a local checkpoint commit run `git diff --check`. For frontend changes run `npm run lint:frontend`, `npm run build:frontend`, and `npm run test:frontend`. For backend changes run the relevant `pytest` tests. Do not push, deploy, tag, or change a release version unless explicitly requested.
